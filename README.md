## Rationale and Approach

### Why Laravel?

-   **Rapid Development:** Laravel provides a robust framework with built-in features like authentication, routing, and database migrations, which significantly speed up development.
-   **Ecosystem:** Laravel has a rich ecosystem with tools like Eloquent ORM, Blade templating, and Artisan CLI, making it ideal for building scalable web applications.
-   **Community Support:** Laravel has a large and active community, ensuring access to plenty of resources and third-party packages.

### Why Alpine.js?

-   **Lightweight:** Alpine.js is a minimal JavaScript framework that adds interactivity to the UI without the overhead of larger frameworks like Vue or React.
-   **Ease of Use:** Alpine.js integrates seamlessly with Laravel Blade templates, making it ideal for small, dynamic UI components like the favourites button.
